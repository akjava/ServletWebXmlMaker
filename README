Only work on Chrome
I created this for reduce time to modified web.xml.
Actually modifying web.xml is old fashion.
we should use more modern framework which don't need modify web.xml
however it's easy this style for small apps.

how to use.
1 select all & copy your servlet java code.(technically it's only parse both package and class line);
plus it's works text only classname.java  or classname
2 paste to this app
3 servlet xml was generated.


example
1.copy your java code
package com.akjava.gwt.qualification.server.admin;
..
public class AdminIndexServlet extends  BaseServlet{
..
}

3.generated xml
<servlet-name>AdminIndex</servlet-name>
<servlet-class>com.akjava.gwt.qualification.server.admin.AdminIndexServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>
<servlet-mapping>
<servlet-name>AdminIndex</servlet-name>
<url-pattern>/adminindex</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
